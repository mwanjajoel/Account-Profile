#  User Account Screen
This repo contains source code for a simple SwiftUI screen showing the different options for a user account. It's one of the many SwiftUI mini projects am doing to master the language. 

## Why SwiftUI
SwiftUI is a refreshing modern and simple way of creating iOS app interfaces and am loving it, so why not? 

## How to Run this project.
Simply clone this repo in your Xcode and hit run! Done!
